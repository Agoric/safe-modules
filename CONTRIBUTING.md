# Contributing 

Please feel free to create PRs to add to or edit the document, as well
as PRs for adding examples as submodules under `/examples`

In each example repo, please add a README.md that explains the example
and links back to this repository. 

## Wrapping

We have a hard wrap at 70. In VSCode, we recommend the `rewrap`
extension.
